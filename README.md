# Mutual Fund Investment Calculator

This is one of the most complex projects/problems I have worked on, yet. It involved a lot of math, and a lot of logical thinking, but finally, it was achieved.

In it's simplest form, it is a mutual fund investment calculator which allows you to **track your SIP (monthly) and Lumpsum investments** and using **real historical NAV data from AMFI**, to track the performance of the fund over time.
